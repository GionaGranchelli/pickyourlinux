# Task 032 – Compatibility Engine Tests

## Objective
Ensure compatibility logic is deterministic and explainable.

---

## Scope
- tests/engine/compatibility.spec.ts

---

## Requirements
Test scenarios:
- “I want things to just work”
- “I have an old laptop”
- “I want privacy but convenience matters”

Each test must assert:
- which distros are excluded
- why they were excluded

---

## Definition of Done
- Tests pass consistently
- No flaky logic
