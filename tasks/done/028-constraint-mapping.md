# Task 028 – User Intent → Distro Constraint Mapping

## Objective
Define how UserIntent constraints map to distro attributes.

---

## Scope
- docs/CONSTRAINT_MAPPING.md

---

## Requirements
- Explicitly document:
    - which user intents are HARD constraints
    - which are SOFT constraints
- Provide examples:
    - “If user wants things to just work → exclude HANDS_ON maintenance”

---

## Definition of Done
- Mapping is explicit and unambiguous
- No ranking logic
- Can be implemented mechanically
