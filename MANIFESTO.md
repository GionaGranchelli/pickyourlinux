# Manifesto
## Pick Your Linux

### We are not here to tell you what to choose.

The internet is full of people telling you which Linux distribution is *best*.  
Most of them mean: *best for me*.

We think that’s the wrong question.

---

## Opinions are not guidance

“Beginner-friendly.”  
“Advanced users only.”  
“Most popular.”  
“Just trust me.”

These words sound helpful, but they hide something important:
**someone else’s taste, bias, or experience**.

Pick Your Linux does not work like that.

---

## We believe in consequences, not recommendations

Instead of asking *“Which distro is best?”*, we ask:

- What do you want to use your computer for?
- Do you want things to just work?
- How much friction are you comfortable with?
- Is this an old machine?
- Do you value privacy over convenience?

Then we show you what follows.

Not our opinion.  
Not a ranking.  
Just the logical consequences of your choices.

---

## Same answers. Same result. Every time.

Our system is deterministic.

That means:
- If two people give the same answers, they get the same outcome.
- If you change one answer, you can see exactly what changes — and why.
- There are no hidden scores, weights, or “magic” adjustments.

Nothing is happening behind your back.

---

## Explainability is not optional

If a Linux distribution is shown, we explain why.  
If a Linux distribution is hidden, we explain why.

You don’t have to trust us.
You can inspect the reasoning yourself.

If you disagree with the result, that’s okay.
The rules are visible. The logic is explicit.

---

## We don’t rank. We don’t promote. We don’t sponsor.

Pick Your Linux does not:
- rank distributions
- promote “featured” picks
- accept sponsorships
- optimize for clicks or trends

There is no mechanism for favoritism — by design.

---

## Learning is a feature

Sometimes the most valuable result is not *what* you get,
but *why* you didn’t get something else.

We want you to understand:
- why some systems demand more involvement
- why some systems trade freedom for convenience
- why your preferences matter more than popularity

Curiosity is welcome here.

---

## You are in control

Pick Your Linux is not an authority.
It’s a mirror.

It reflects your choices back to you — clearly, honestly, and without judgment.

If you want to explore, change answers.
If you want to challenge assumptions, do it.
If you want to disagree, the system will still respect you.

---

## Our promise

We promise to:
- keep the logic transparent
- keep the questions human
- keep opinions out of the engine
- keep trust at the center

Because choosing an operating system
should not require joining a tribe.

**Pick Your Linux**  
*Not opinions. Just logic.*
