# UI Copy Rules

This document keeps product copy neutral, explainable, and non-opinionated.

---

## Forbidden Words and Phrases

Do not use these in UI copy:
- best
- top
- perfect
- ultimate
- recommended #1
- “best distro” / “top distro”

---

## Required Phrasing

Prefer these patterns:
- “compatible with your choices”
- “based on what you selected”
- “you can refine this”
- “no rankings or opinions”

---

## Beginner Flow Language

- Avoid jargon (rolling release, init system, package manager) in the beginner phase.
- Explain concepts in human terms when they appear.

---

## Quick Checklist

Before merging UI changes, confirm:
- No ranking language appears.
- The UI never implies a single “best” distro.
- The user’s agency is emphasized.
