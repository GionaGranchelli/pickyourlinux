# Feedback Collection Plan

## Principles
- No in-app surveys at launch.
- Feedback is opt-in and external.
- Questions must be neutral and non-leading.

## Channels
- Public GitHub issues (feature requests + bug reports)
- Email inbox for private feedback
- Optional community discussions (e.g., forum or Discord)

## Neutral Prompts
- “What was unclear?”
- “What surprised you?”
- “What would you change first?”

## Not Included (for now)
- No pop-up prompts
- No behavioral tracking tied to answers
- No engagement scoring
