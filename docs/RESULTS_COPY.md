# Results Copy and Messaging

This copy explains results as compatibility, not "best".
It follows the Manifesto: transparent, non-judgmental, and deterministic.

---

## Header
**Your Compatibility Results**

## Subheader
These results reflect the constraints you chose. There is no ranking.

---

## Short Explanation
- Multiple matches are normal.
- No match means a constraint ruled them out.
- You can change any answer to see how outcomes change.

---

## If There Are Several Matches
"These options fit your stated constraints. You can compare them or adjust your answers to explore other outcomes."

---

## If Few or No Matches
"Your answers set strict constraints. Try relaxing one choice to see more compatible options."

---

## CTA Suggestions
- "Change an answer"
- "Review my choices"
- "Start over"

---

## Tone Rules
- Avoid "best", "recommended", "top".
- Avoid skill labels.
- Emphasize consequences and transparency.
